# Bubb

Drop a message. Anywhere.

Bubb allows to drop a message in any location they are at. This message will be visible to people that will stand in the zone.

This could have potential use in games, social medias, and more.

When someone arrives at a location they can log in and drop a thought bubble where they stand.

They simply add a thought (limited to 250 characters), a radius of visibility, an expiration date and if it is signed or anonymous.
